					<li>The aurora borealis is a natural light display in the Earth's atmosphere that occurs when charged particles from the sun collide with atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere.The aurora borealis appears as swirling rivers of greenish-blue light that move and dance unpredictably across the sky.</li>
					<li>The lights can appear as spirals, curtains, flickers, or rays.The aurora borealis is most commonly seen in the auroral oval, a belt around the north magnetic pole that passes over northern Scandinavia, Iceland, the southern tip of Greenland, Alaska, and Canada.The best time to see the aurora borealis is between 11 PM and 2 AM. The months with the highest activity are spring (March/April) and autumn (September/October).</li>
					<li>The Northern Lights Feature in Norse Mythology:Norse legend has it that the lights are reflections from the armour and shield of the great Valkyries. These great female warriors would choose which of the fallen warriors would gain their entry to Valhalla (heaven for the warriors and gods).</li>
