			<p class="fs-5">The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1648. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The surrounding buildings and garden were finished in 1653.The Taj Mahal was built using materials from all over India and Central Asia, including white Makrana marble from Jodhpur and precious stones from Baghdad, Punjab, Egypt, Russia, and more.The Taj Mahal is increasingly seen as an Indian cultural symbol.The Taj Mahal's design was influenced by other tombs, including Humayun's tomb, which featured a central dome, geometric planning, and iwan entrances. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Its design is a synthesis of Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural traditions. The crenellated walls on three sides and the Yamuna on the fourth side separate the monumentâ€™s 42-acre grounds from the rest of the surrounding land. It was built out of white Makrana marble that was sourced from the Indian state of Rajasthan. To further enhance the beauty of the memorial, thousands of precious and semi-precious gemstones were also incorporated into its design.
